# Bubble Dance VR
 
A Prototype of a dance vr game for Oculus. Has a scene for playing the game where you pop bubbles according to the beat, and another scene where you edit the location of the bubbles while scrubbing through a video timeline. Is very rough and unpolished and only has one song at the moment.
